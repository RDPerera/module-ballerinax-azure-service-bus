## Package overview

Azure Service Bus is an asynchronous messaging cloud platform that enables you to send and receive messages between decoupled systems. Microsoft offers this feature as a service, which means that you do not need to host any of your own hardware in order to use it.

Refer to [azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/) to learn more about Service Bus.

The `ballerinax/asb` is a [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) connector for Microsoft Azure Service Bus.
This package offers usage and management capabilities for Azure Service Bus resources, including queues, topics, subscriptions, and rules.
